## this is a sample function for controlling a drone's takeoff and landing using Python:



import time

class Drone:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_flying = False

    def takeoff(self):
        if not self.is_flying:
            print("Drone is taking off.")
            time.sleep(2)  # Simulate takeoff duration
            self.is_flying = True
        else:
            print("Drone is already in the air.")

    def land(self):
        if self.is_flying:
            print("Drone is landing.")
            time.sleep(2)  # Simulate landing duration
            self.is_flying = False
        else:
            print("Drone is already on the ground.")

# Example usage
my_drone = Drone()
my_drone.takeoff()
my_drone.land()
